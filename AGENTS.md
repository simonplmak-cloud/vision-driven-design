# AGENTS.md — Vision Driven Design Skill

This is an **OpenCode AI skill repository** — primarily static documentation with a thin MCP API layer.

## File Roles — Authoritative Sources

Each concept has one canonical source. Update the source, then propagate.

| Concept | Canonical Source | Derived Copies |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Artifact structures | `artifact-templates.md` | SKILL.md directory structure section |
| Phase steps | `workflow-phases.md` | SKILL.md phase summary |
| Prompts | `prompt-patterns.md` | ai-agent-patterns.md |
| Gate checks and counts | `quality-gates.md` | SKILL.md, README.md, quick-reference.md |
| Anti-patterns | `anti-patterns.md` | INDEX.md troubleshooting section |
| Commands | SKILL.md | README.md, quick-reference.md |

## Conventions

### Impact Chain Headers
Every artifact template includes: `> Impact Chain: V-001 → S-002 → T-003 → SP-004 → PL-005 → TK-006`
Prefixes: `V-` (Vision), `S-` (Strategy), `T-` (Tactics), `A-` (Action Item), `SP-` (Spec), `PL-` (Plan), `TK-` (Tasks), `I-` (Impact), `R-` (Risk), `AC-` (Acceptance Criterion).

### Bi-Directional Gates
Each gate has forward checks (parent→children), backward checks (children→parent), and 4 S&T assumptions (Necessity, Achievability, Sufficiency, Warnings). Total check count (113) must stay consistent across SKILL.md, README.md, quick-reference.md, and quality-gates.md.

### Anti-Patterns
Numbered sequentially from AP1 upward. Append new ones at the end — do not renumber existing. Update INDEX.md's troubleshooting section.

## Editing Gotchas

- **SKILL.md's YAML frontmatter** uses the OpenCode skill format. Do not change the format without checking the OpenCode skill spec.
- **Command tables** appear in 3 files (SKILL.md, README.md, quick-reference.md). Add new commands to all three.
- **Phase numbering** (0–8) is stable. Phase 0 is Constitution. Phases 1–3 are VDD additions. Phases 4–8 are the SDD chain. Never renumber.
- **Gate check counts** in `quality-gates.md` Gate Summary Table must match actual checklist items. Total (113) = sum of F/B/A columns across G1–G7.
- **Domain primers** — the original 4 (webapp, data-storage, etl, infrastructure) are loaded per-domain based on vision targets. `human-factors.md` and `verification-toolchain.md` are loaded unconditionally. `safety-critical.md` is loaded when the vision involves regulated domains.
- **API and packages** — `api/` contains the Vercel MCP endpoint. `packages/` contains the TypeScript monorepo. Build configuration is scoped to these directories; core documentation (SKILL.md, references/, domain-primers/) remains build-free.

## Superset Relationship

VDD absorbs SDD. Every SDD command, feature, gate check, and anti-pattern must have an equivalent in VDD:
- `/vdd:specify "freeform description"` must work without a V/S/T chain.
- All SDD artifact paths (`constitution.md`, `specs/`, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `tasks.md`) are preserved under `vdd/`.
- SDD's Boundaries section, MoSCoW labels, Clarify step, and Assumptions Surface prompt must exist in VDD's Phase 4.
