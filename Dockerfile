# VDD MCP server — Streamable HTTP transport on port 3000.
#
# Builds the TypeScript monorepo and serves the 16 VDD MCP tools over the MCP
# Streamable HTTP transport, for self-hosting or any remote client.
#
# Note: Glama does NOT build from this file — it generates its own container
# from the stdio entrypoint (packages/vdd-mcp/dist/stdio.js), wrapped with
# mcp-proxy. This image is for self-hosting the HTTP transport.
#
# The stdio entrypoint remains available for local `npx @simonmak-ascent/mcp`
# use; this image runs the HTTP transport.
