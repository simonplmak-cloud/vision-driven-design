# Vision Driven Design

## Overview

VDD makes **vision the source of all traceability**. Instead of starting at the spec level
and hoping the resulting code advances the business impact, VDD starts with a human's
broad vision statement and drives the entire chain — research, strategy, repository audit,
specification, planning, implementation, and validation — through AI agents with
bi-directional verification at every junction.

Core principle: *"Every line of code must be able to answer two questions: 'What vision
goal do I serve?' and 'Why am I necessary to achieve it?'"*

VDD extends and absorbs Spec-Driven Development (SDD). SDD's `Specs → Plan → Tasks →
Implement → Validate` chain is preserved and enhanced, but VDD adds three upstream phases
(Vision, Strategy, Tactics) that ground every spec in measurable real-world impact.
The combined 8-phase chain is governed by Goldratt's recursive Strategy-Tactic
decomposition: every phase's Tactic is the next phase's Strategy, creating a natural
recursive chain with built-in bidirectional verification.

### Spec Levels

VDD inherits SDD's three spec posture levels, extended to apply at every chain level:

| Level | What it means | Best for |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Spec-first** | Write spec upfront, implement immediately | Most features with clear requirements |
| **Strategy-first** | Research strategy upfront, then derive specs | New domains, uncertain markets |
| **Vision-first** | Define vision upfront, then research+spec | New products, major pivots |
| **Spec-anchored** | Maintain artifact alongside code as it evolves | Long-lived features |
| **Spec-as-source** | Artifact is primary; code is generated, never hand-edited | High-compliance, safety-critical |

Start with vision-first for new products. Use spec-first for features within an established vision.

### The Bi-Directional Difference

Traditional SDD verifies forward (does the code match the spec?). VDD verifies in both
directions at every level:

| Direction | Question | Detects |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Forward** (parent → children) | "Does every parent goal have children that collectively cover it?" | Uncovered goals, incomplete decomposition |
| **Backward** (children → parent) | "Does every child artifact trace back to an authorized parent?" | Scope creep, gold-plating, orphan code |

Without backward verification: code ships that nobody asked for.
Without forward verification: vision goals ship with no implementation.

## Quick Start

1. **Write your vision** (2 minutes):
   Type 1-3 paragraphs describing the impact you want to create. Be broad. Be ambitious.
   The AI handles the rest.

2. **Let the chain run**:
   `/vdd:vision "I want to build a platform that..."` → AI expands, researches, audits
   your codebase, generates specs, plans, tasks, and implements — all with bidirectional
   verification at every gate.

   **Or run end-to-end**:
   `/vdd:e2e "your vision"` → executes the full 8-phase chain (init→vision→strategize→
   tactics→specify→clarify→plan→tasks→next-task→validate) in a single command, writing all 10+
   template files to your project.

3. **Review at the end**:
   `/vdd:validate` produces a full-chain traceability matrix and impact verification
   report. Every line of code traces back to your original vision statement.

## When to Use

### Use VDD when:
- Starting a new product or major feature from a vision/impact goal
- You want AI to fully autonomously drive development from vision to code
- The project touches webapp, data storage, ETL, or infrastructure domains
- You need auditable traceability from business goals to shipped code
- Previous "just build it" attempts produced features that didn't advance impact
- You need to onboard new team members to WHY the code exists (not just WHAT it does)

### Skip VDD for:
- Bug fixes under 30 minutes
- Configuration changes or typo fixes
- Throwaway prototypes where requirements will immediately change
- Changes unrelated to any vision goal

### Key Practice: Reframe Vague Requirements

Before writing any AC, convert vague requirements into measurable targets:

| Vague | Concrete |
|-------|---------|
| "make it faster" | "LCP < 2.5s on a 4G connection" |
| "it should be secure" | "requires authenticated session; all inputs validated before processing" |
| "handle errors properly" | "returns 4xx with structured error code, never exposes stack traces" |
| "should scale" | "handles 1000 concurrent users at < 500ms p95" |
| "works correctly" | "Given X, When Y, Then Z — independently verifiable" |
| "good UX" | "WCAG 2.2 AA compliant; task completion rate > 80%" |

If you cannot write a passing test for an AC, the AC is not concrete enough.
This applies at every level: vision metrics must be measurable, strategy pillars
must be verifiable, tactical items must be actionable, and ACs must be testable.

### Phase Summary

| # | Phase | Human Role | AI Role |
|---|-------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Constitution | Provide tech stack, conventions | Generate immutable project rules |
| 1 | Vision | Write 1-3 paragraph impact statement | Expand into structured vision.md |
| 2 | Strategy | (optional: redirect) | Spawn 5 parallel research subagents, synthesize findings |
| 3 | Tactics | (optional: re-prioritize) | Full repo audit → gap analysis → prioritized action items |
| 4 | Specs | (optional: clarify ambiguities) | Generate precise acceptance criteria per action item. Can also accept freeform description directly via `/vdd:specify "description"` — skips V/S/T for simple cases. |
| 5 | Plan | (optional: review architecture) | Technical design, data models, API contracts |
| 6 | Tasks | (optional: adjust ordering) | Break plan into test-first atomic tasks |
| 7 | Implement | (optional: review PRs) | Execute tasks one by one, fresh context per task |
| 8 | Validate | Review impact report | Full-chain traceability matrix, drift detection, impact verification |

**In full-auto mode (default):** human provides only the Vision. AI handles everything else,
including self-gating all 7 bidirectional verification gates.

**E2E shortcut:** `/vdd:e2e "vision"` runs the entire chain in one call.

## 7 Bi-Directional Gates

Each gate verifies both directions and validates 4 S&T assumptions:

| Gate | Forward Check | Backward Check |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **G1 (V→S)** | Every vision goal has ≥1 strategy pillar | Every pillar traces to a vision goal |
| **G2 (S→T)** | Every pillar has ≥1 tactical action item | Every action item traces to a pillar |
| **G3 (T→SP)** | Every MUST action item has a spec | Every AC traces to an action item |
| **G4 (SP→PL)** | Every AC has ≥1 plan component | Every component traces to an AC |
| **G5 (PL→TK)** | Every component has ≥1 task | Every task traces to a component |
| **G6 (TK→IM)** | Every task produces passing code | Every commit traces to a task |
| **G7 (IM→VS)** | Every MUST AC has passing tests | Every code artifact traces to vision. User story walkthrough complete. |

**108 total checks** (42 forward + 38 backward + 28 S&T assumptions).

| `domain-primers/human-factors.md` | Every project (unconditional) | Behavioral economics, cognitive load, habit formation |
| `domain-primers/verification-toolchain.md` | Every project (unconditional) | Playwright, Browserless, Sentry, CI/CD quality pipeline |
| `domain-primers/webapp.md` | Vision targets web applications | UX, accessibility, performance, framework evaluation |
| `domain-primers/data-storage.md` | Vision involves persistent data | Schema design, indexing, data governance |
| `domain-primers/etl.md` | Vision involves data pipelines | Pipeline architecture, data quality, streaming vs batch |
| `domain-primers/infrastructure.md` | Vision involves deployment/platform | CI/CD, observability, security, scaling, disaster recovery |

## MCP & Packages

The public MCP server at `vdd.simonmak.com/api/sse` and the TypeScript packages are in this repo:
- `api/sse.js` — deployed Vercel handler (16 tools)
- `packages/vdd-engine/` — shared core (16 phase functions + `meta.ts`: phase metadata, tool requirements, research subagents, domain primers)
- `packages/vdd-mcp/` — MCP server (16 tools, stdio + SSE)
- `packages/vdd-cli/` — CLI binary (16 subcommands, `--json`)

**Capability contract:** the MCP is the *structured orchestration + verification* layer — it emits
research-subagent dispatch specs, per-phase tool requirements (`/vdd:detect-environment`), domain-primer
lists, and enforces substantive (non-placeholder) gates. The **host agent** executes research, codebase
audit, and implementation using its own environment MCP tools (Brave Search, Perplexity, Context7,
gh_grep, Playwright, filesystem). A freshly generated template is marked NOT-ready (gates report
placeholders) until the host agent fills it in and re-runs `/vdd:validate`.
