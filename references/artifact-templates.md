## constitution.md Template

*Created once per project at the root. Applied to every phase, every feature.*

```markdown
# Project Constitution

Version: 1.0.0
Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Architecture Principles

- [e.g., "API-first: all features expose a REST endpoint before any UI is built"]
- [e.g., "Server Components by default; use client components only when required"]
- [e.g., "No ORM other than Drizzle; raw SQL only for complex analytics queries"]

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Language | TypeScript 5.x | Strict mode, no `any` |
| Runtime | Node.js 20+ | |
| Framework | [e.g., Next.js 15+] | App Router only |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Drizzle | No direct SQL in route handlers |
| Auth | [e.g., Better Auth] | No custom auth logic outside the auth module |
| Testing | Vitest + Playwright | |

## Security Constraints

- Authentication: all endpoints require a valid session unless explicitly marked `[PUBLIC]`
- Input validation: all external inputs validated with Zod at the route boundary
- SQL injection: parameterized queries only — never string-concatenate user input into queries
- Secrets: never log tokens, passwords, or PII; never hardcode secrets
- CORS: allow-list only — no wildcard origins in production
- Rate limiting: all public endpoints must declare a rate limit in their contract

## Naming Conventions

- Files: kebab-case (`user-repository.ts`)
- Variables/functions: camelCase
- Types/interfaces: PascalCase
- DB columns: snake_case
- Env vars: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

## Banned Patterns

- No `any` type in TypeScript
- No `console.log` in production code (use logger)
- No synchronous file I/O in request handlers
- No direct DOM manipulation (use React)
- No [project-specific banned pattern]

## File Structure Rules

```
src/
  app/          # Routes and pages
  components/   # Shared UI components
  lib/          # Business logic and utilities
  db/           # Schema, migrations, repositories
  types/        # Shared TypeScript types
```

## Domain Primitives

<!-- Which domain-primers apply to this project? -->
- webapp
- data-storage
- [etl / infrastructure]

## Open Questions / Deferred Decisions

- [PENDING] [Decision 1]: [context and options]

## vision.md Template

*Created once per product/feature. The root of all traceability. Human provides a freeform statement; AI formalizes into this template.*

```markdown
# Vision

> Impact Chain: V-001

Status: Approved
Version: 1.0
Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Vision Statement

<!-- Non-technical 1-3 paragraphs describing the intended impact.
     Who benefits? What changes in their world? Why does it matter? -->

[Human's freeform vision, expanded and formalized by AI]

## Impact Model

### Goal (the desired future state)

[1 sentence — the measurable outcome this product aims to create]

### Actors (who must behave differently)

| Actor | Current State | Desired State | Benefit |
|-------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| [Primary user] | [What they do today] | [What they will do] | [Why it's better] |
| [Secondary user] | [What they do today] | [What they will do] | [Why it's better] |

### Impacts (the behavioral changes that produce the goal)

| Impact ID | Description | Actor | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| I-001 | [Behavioral change] | [Actor] | [How to measure] |
| I-002 | [Behavioral change] | [Actor] | [How to measure] |

## Stakeholder Map

| Role | Interest | Influence | Engagement Strategy |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| [Primary user] | [What they care about] | High | [How to involve them] |
| [Decision maker] | [What they care about] | High | [How to involve them] |
| [Secondary beneficiary] | [What they care about] | Medium | [How to involve them] |

## Success Metrics

### Lagging Indicators (the outcomes — measured months after launch)

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| [e.g., User retention at day 30] | [e.g., > 40%] | [e.g., Analytics event + cohort analysis] |
| [e.g., Net Promoter Score] | [e.g., > 50] | [e.g., In-app survey at day 14] |

### Leading Indicators (early signals — measured during build & launch)

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| [e.g., Activation rate] | [e.g., > 60%] | [e.g., Completed key journey within first session] |
| [e.g., Time to first value] | [e.g., < 5 min] | [e.g., Analytics event timing] |

## Constraints & Boundaries

### Constraints (non-negotiable)

- [e.g., Must serve users in regions X, Y, Z]
- [e.g., Must comply with regulation ABC]
- [e.g., Must work offline in low-connectivity environments]

### Boundaries (explicitly out of vision scope)

- [e.g., Not targeting enterprise customers in v1]
- [e.g., Not replacing existing system X — complementing it]

## Target Domains

<!-- Check all that apply. Load corresponding domain-primers during Strategy phase. -->
- [ ] WebApp
- [ ] Data Storage
- [ ] ETL
- [ ] Infrastructure

## S&T Assumptions (Vision → Strategy)

<!-- Filled by AI during Gate G1 — how this Vision decomposes into Strategy -->

**Necessity:** Why is Strategy-level research necessary to achieve this Vision?

**Achievability:** Why is this Vision achievable given the planned Strategy approach?

**Sufficiency:** Why is the planned Strategy approach sufficient to realize this Vision?

**Warnings:** What must go right / be avoided for Strategy to succeed?

## tactics.md Template

*AI-generated during Phase 3. Full repository audit. Gap analysis. Action items feed directly into Specs.*

```markdown
# Tactics

> Impact Chain: V-001 → S-002 → T-003

Status: Draft
Version: 1.0
Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Strategy Reference
Derived from: `vdd/strategy.md`

## Codebase Audit

### What Exists

| Asset | Location | Purpose | Strategic Pillar Trace | Quality |
|-------|----------|---------|----------------------|---------|
| [e.g., User auth module] | `src/auth/` | [What it does] | [Which pillar] | Good / Needs Refactor / Replace |
| [e.g., Dashboard page] | `src/app/dashboard/` | [What it does] | [Which pillar] | Good / Needs Refactor / Replace |

### Technical Debt Assessment

| Debt Item | Location | Severity | Impact on Strategy |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| [e.g., No input validation] | `src/api/` | High | Blocks Pillar 1 (security) |
| [e.g., Missing indexes] | `db/schema.ts` | Medium | Slows Pillar 2 (analytics) |

### Reusable Assets

| Asset | How It Supports Strategy | Effort to Reuse |
|-------|------------------------|----------------|
| [e.g., Shared component library] | Accelerates Pillar 1 UI | Low |
| [e.g., Existing API patterns] | Consistent with Pillar 2 | Low |

## Gap Analysis

| Gap | Strategic Pillar Affected | Impact if Unaddressed |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|
| [e.g., No mobile-responsive layout] | Pillar 1 (UX) | Vision target audience unreachable |
| [e.g., No analytics pipeline] | Pillar 2 (Data) | Cannot measure success metrics |

## Prioritized Action Items

<!-- Each action item feeds directly into a spec.md via /vdd:specify.
     Priority follows MoSCoW: [MUST] = required for vision, [SHOULD] = important, [COULD] = nice -->

| ID | Action Item | Priority | Strategy Pillar | Estimated Spec Size | Dependencies |
|----|------------|----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|
| A-001 | [e.g., User authentication with SSO] | MUST | Pillar 1 | M | None |
| A-002 | [e.g., Responsive dashboard redesign] | MUST | Pillar 1 | L | None |
| A-003 | [e.g., Analytics data pipeline] | SHOULD | Pillar 2 | M | A-001 |
| A-004 | [e.g., Export to CSV] | COULD | Pillar 2 | S | A-003 |

## Dependency Map

```
A-001 (Auth) ──┐
               ├──→ A-003 (Analytics) ──→ A-004 (Export)
A-002 (UI) ────┘
```

## Infrastructure Requirements

| Requirement | Domain | Priority | Notes |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| [e.g., CI/CD pipeline] | Infrastructure | MUST | GitHub Actions for deploy |
| [e.g., Monitoring dashboards] | Infrastructure | SHOULD | Grafana + Prometheus |
| [e.g., Multi-region DB] | Data Storage | SHOULD | Postgres read replicas |
| [e.g., ETL for analytics] | ETL | SHOULD | dbt + Airflow |

## S&T Assumptions (Tactics → Specs)

<!-- Filled by AI during Gate G3 — how Tactics decompose into Specs -->

**Necessity:** Why are Spec-level requirements necessary to execute these Tactical action items?

**Achievability:** Why are these Tactical items achievable given the planned Spec approach?

**Sufficiency:** Why is the planned Spec approach sufficient to implement these Tactical items?

**Warnings:** What must go right / be avoided for Specs to succeed?
