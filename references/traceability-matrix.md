# Traceability Matrix

The bi-directional traceability matrix (RTM) is the audit mechanism that proves the VDD chain is complete. It can be generated at any time with `/vdd:trace` and is automatically generated during Phase 8 (Validate).

## RTM Structure

### Full Chain

```
Vision (V-XXX) ──→ Strategy (S-XXX) ──→ Tactics (T-XXX) ──→ Spec (SP-XXX)
                                                                  ↓
Validate ←── Implementation ←── Tasks (TK-XXX) ←── Plan (PL-XXX)
```

## Automated RTM Generation

The `/vdd:trace` command reads all VDD artifacts and generates the matrix automatically.

### Algorithm

```
1. Walk vdd/ directory for all .md files
2. Extract Impact Chain headers from each file
3. Build parent → child map from chain headers
4. Build child → parent map (reverse of above)
5. Detect orphans: files modified in git that have no task coverage
6. Detect uncovered: parent artifacts with no children
7. Scan test files for AC references
8. Scan implementation files for contract references
9. Run drift checks (API signatures vs contracts, DB schema vs data-model)
10. Validate S&T assumptions from each gate's documentation
11. Output RTM markdown
```

### CI/CD Integration

        run: |

          changed=$(git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD -- src/)
          for f in $changed; do
            if ! grep -rq "$f" vdd/specs/*/tasks.md; then

## Quick Trace Query Patterns

| Question | How to Answer |
|----------|--------------|
| "Why does this code exist?" | Follow the chain upward: commit → task → plan → spec → tactics → strategy → vision |
| "Is every vision goal implemented?" | Forward coverage table — check every V-XXX has children |
| "What code changed outside specs?" | Orphan detection — files modified without task coverage |
| "Is any spec AC untested?" | AC Coverage Matrix — ACs with no test file |
| "Did we build the right thing?" | Impact Verification — compare built features against vision impact model |
| "What's blocking release?" | RTM → Release Readiness section |
