# Quality Gates

Seven bi-directional gates — one between each phase pair. Each gate has forward (parent → children) and backward (children → parent) verification, plus 4 S&T assumption validations.

In full-auto mode, AI self-gates all checks and only halts for human intervention if a gate fails self-repair. In gated mode, human approval is required before proceeding past each gate.

## Substance Enforcement

Every gate includes a substance check. Cosmetic-only contributions fail the gate regardless of traceability coverage.

| Gate | Substance Check | Fail Condition |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| G1 (V→S) | Every strategy pillar cites ≥1 research finding | Pillar with no citation = rejected |
| G2 (S→T) | Every [MUST] action item describes a concrete behavior change | "Improve UX" without measurable target = rejected |
| G3 (T→SP) | Every spec has ≥1 [MUST] AC that changes observable behavior | Spec with zero MUST ACs = rejected |
| G4 (SP→PL) | Every plan component describes a specific technical decision | "Add component" with no design detail = rejected |
| G5 (PL→TK) | Every task description is concrete enough for a fresh AI context to execute | Task that says "Fix things" = rejected |
| G6 (TK→IM) | Every commit changes behavior, not just comments or formatting | Comment-only or whitespace-only commit = rejected |
| G7 (IM→VS) | Full chain substance audit — no phase produced purely ceremonial output | Any artifact flagged as "no substance" by G1-G6 = chain tainted |

## Gate Summary Table

| Gate | Junction | Forward Checks | Backward Checks | S&T Assumptions |
|------|----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| G0 | (pre-chain) | — | — | — |

## Confidence-Based Review Thresholds

| Confidence | Conditions | Gate Behavior (Full-Auto Mode) |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------|
| **High (>90%)** | All checks pass with no warnings. Simple CRUD, no auth changes, no schema changes. | Auto-pass. Skip human review. |
| **Medium (70-90%)** | Most checks pass. Minor warnings. Cross-service integration, new API, UI component. | Auto-pass with warnings logged. |
| **Low (<70%)** | Multiple checks fail or have warnings. Auth logic, schema migration, external API. | Halt for human review before proceeding. |
| **Critical** | Payment flows, auth core, data encryption. Any High-impact risk with no mitigation. | Mandatory halt. Human required. |
